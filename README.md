# A-More-Efficient-Rating-Prediction-in-Recommendation-System
We proposed a model that make the rating prediction in recommendation on the LDOS_COMODA dataset using the Machine Learning Algorithms


We used many algorithms such as : K Nearest Neighbord (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Linear Regression (LR), Principal Components (PCA) and Truncate Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD).

MAke the comparison with PCA and SVD to reduce the dimensions of the dataset and select the better one after the evaluation of models.

**Models 1)   PCA : reduction dimensions matrices**

A )  PCA with KNN,

B )  PCA with LR 

and

C )PCA With NB

**Models 2)   SVD : reduction dimensions matrices**

A' )  SVD with KNN,

B' )   SVD with LR 

and

C)     SVD With NB

the better model was selected after the experimentations. the model is : SVD and KNN
